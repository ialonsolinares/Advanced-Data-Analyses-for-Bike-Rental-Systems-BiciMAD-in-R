In this repository, you will find common and advanced data analyses for bike rental systems. In particular, this repository contains:

  1. Analysis of trip data from the bike rental system of Madrid, combined with coordinates of each station and weather data - clustering and assymetry
     
  2. ARIMA/SARIMA Model development for Demand forecasting of bike rental systems
     
  3. A novel approach on rebalancing more efficiently the system (correcting assymetry) using Time Series Clustering and Dynamic Time Wraping distances.
